    Hello, everyone! This is the LONGEST TEXT EVER! I was inspired by the various other "longest texts ever" on the
    internet, and I wanted to make my own. So here it is! This is going to be a WORLD RECORD! This is actually my
    third attempt at doing this. The first time, I didn't save it. The second time, the Neocities editor crashed.
    Now I'm writing this in Notepad, then copying it into the Neocities editor instead of typing it directly in the
    Neocities editor to avoid crashing. It sucks that my past two attempts are gone now. Those actually got pretty
    long. Not the longest, but still pretty long. I hope this one won't get lost somehow. Anyways, let's talk about
    WAFFLES! I like waffles. Waffles are cool. Waffles is a funny word. There's a Teen Titans Go episode called
    "Waffles" where the word "Waffles" is said a hundred-something times. It's pretty annoying. There's also a Teen
    Titans Go episode about Pig Latin. Don't know what Pig Latin is? It's a language where you take all the
    consonants before the first vowel, move them to the end, and add '-ay' to the end. If the word begins with a
    vowel, you just add '-way' to the end. For example, "Waffles" becomes "Afflesway". I've been speaking Pig Latin
    fluently since the fourth grade, so it surprised me when I saw the episode for the first time. I speak Pig Latin
    with my sister sometimes. It's pretty fun. I like speaking it in public so that everyone around us gets
    confused. That's never actually happened before, but if it ever does, 'twill be pretty funny. By the way,
    "'twill" is a word I invented recently, and it's a contraction of "it will". I really hope it gains popularity
    in the near future, because "'twill" is WAY more fun than saying "it'll". "It'll" is too boring. Nobody likes
    boring. This is nowhere near being the longest text ever, but eventually it will be! I might still be writing
    this a decade later, who knows? But right now, it's not very long. But I'll just keep writing until it is the
    longest! Have you ever heard the song "Dau Dau" by Awesome Scampis? It's an amazing song. Look it up on YouTube!
    I play that song all the time around my sister! It drives her crazy, and I love it. Another way I like driving
    my sister crazy is by speaking my own made up language to her. She hates the languages I make! The only language
    that we both speak besides English is Pig Latin. I think you already knew that. Whatever. I think I'm gonna go
    for now. Bye! Hi, I'm back now. I'm gonna contribute more to this soon-to-be giant wall of text. I just realised
    I have a giant stuffed frog on my bed. I forgot his name. I'm pretty sure it was something stupid though. I
    think it was "FROG" in Morse Code or something. Morse Code is cool. I know a bit of it, but I'm not very good at
    it. I'm also not very good at French. I barely know anything in French, and my pronunciation probably sucks. But
    I'm learning it, at least. I'm also learning Esperanto. It's this language that was made up by some guy a long
    time ago to be the "universal language". A lot of people speak it. I am such a language nerd. Half of this text
    is probably gonna be about languages. But hey, as long as it's long! Ha, get it? As LONG as it's LONG? I'm so
    funny, right? No, I'm not. I should probably get some sleep. Goodnight! Hello, I'm back again. I basically have
    only two interests nowadays: languages and furries. What? Oh, sorry, I thought you knew I was a furry. Haha,
    oops. Anyway, yeah, I'm a furry, but since I'm a young furry, I can't really do as much as I would like to do in
    the fandom. When I'm older, I would like to have a fursuit, go to furry conventions, all that stuff. But for now
    I can only dream of that. Sorry you had to deal with me talking about furries, but I'm honestly very desperate
    for this to be the longest text ever. Last night I was watching nothing but fursuit unboxings. I think I need
    help. This one time, me and my mom were going to go to a furry Christmas party, but we didn't end up going
    because of the fact that there was alcohol on the premises, and that she didn't wanna have to be a mom dragging
    her son through a crowd of furries. Both of those reasons were understandable. Okay, hopefully I won't have to talk
    about furries anymore. I don't care if you're a furry reading this right now, I just don't wanna have to torture
    everyone else. I will no longer say the F word throughout the rest of this entire text. Of course, by the F word, I
    mean the one that I just used six times, not the one that you're probably thinking of which I have not used
    throughout this entire text. I just realised that next year will be 2020.
